# 📝 **GitHub Activity Logger** 🚀

Welcome to the **GitHub Activity Logger**! This Python script automatically updates your GitHub repository with a small change to your README file every hour. It's a simple and effective way to track your daily coding activities! 🎉

## 🌟 **What Does It Do?**

- ⏰ **Hourly Updates:** This script runs every hour to append a small character to your `README.md` file. You can modify the code to track specific activities, but for now, it appends a character ("A") every hour.  
- 🚀 **Auto Git Operations:** It automatically clones or pulls the latest version of your GitHub repository, commits the changes, and pushes them back to GitHub.  
- 🔄 **Runs 24/7:** The script runs indefinitely, waiting for the next scheduled job, and will restart if any errors are encountered. Perfect for automation lovers! 🤖

## 🔧 **How It Works**

1. **Set Git Identity**  
   The script automatically sets your Git username and email for every commit. 🖊️

2. **Clone or Pull Repo**  
   If the repository is not present locally, it clones the repo. If it exists, it pulls the latest changes from GitHub. 🔄

3. **Modify the README**  
   It appends the character "A" to your `README.md` file, making a small but regular change to the repository. ✨

4. **Push Changes**  
   Once the changes are made, the script commits the modification and pushes it to GitHub. 💻

5. **Automated Scheduling**  
   The script runs every hour without any manual intervention. 🕐

6. **Error Handling & Restart**  
   If something goes wrong, the script restarts automatically to ensure it keeps running smoothly. 🔄
